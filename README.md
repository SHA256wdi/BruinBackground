# Prework - Bruin Background
Submitted by: Shawdi Sani
Bruin Background is an app that tells the user a little bit about my personal background and changes the literal background color when the user presses a button in the Bruin Bear.
Time spent: 5 hours spent in total, a good portion of this time was reading and researching Swift using Apple and CodePathâ€™s Swift Guides and watching YouTube videos.
## Required Features
The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color 
## Video Walkthrough
Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming 
Favorite Apps and Why:
1. Spotify
- The feature where I can search lyrics to a song that I cannot remember the name of and it will match and find the song, most of the time.
- The Spotify Wrapped yearly analysis of listening history. I am a huge music and numbers nerd so getting to see my yearly statistics is always really cool, although I wish it was more in-depth like last.fm. 

2. Letterboxd
- I like how you can create lists and share them or collaborate with friends. 
- The shuffle films feature is nice when I cannot decide on what to watch. 

3. Google Calendar
- The feature that lets you integrate existing calendars from elsewhere and add them to your calendar list
- The ability to create your own calendars and edit the colors so they can be color-coordinated has helped me keep track of my assignments and meetings. It also makes getting organized fun! 

**App Idea**

BreakFast is an app that allows users to enter two different schools and it will return the dates when both schools have overlapping days off based on their respective academic calendars. 
Additional Features:
Filter for preferences
Allow users to filter breaks by duration (e.g., long weekends, mid-term breaks).
Customize event suggestions based on user preferences (e.g., nightlife, academic workshops, outdoor activities).
 Travel guides:
Include nearby transportation options (buses, trains, rideshares) for planning visits between campuses.
Partner with travel companies or apps for discounted student deals.
Group planning
Expand beyond two users to support group planning for students from multiple schools.
Suggest overlapping dates and group-friendly activities or venues.
## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My greatest challenge was just familiarizing myself with Swift syntax as it was brand new to me. The CodePath and Apple Swift guides were incredibly helpful though. THe next biggest challenge was familiarizing myself with the Swift development environment and GUI. It is complex and has a lot of layers, but it is worth learning as it makes your coding journey much easier when you know all the features and helpful tools at your disposal.
